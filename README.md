# ExposeProducts

ExposeProducts is a simple SpringBoot RESTful API that is designed to present the user with endpoints that can be called to get information about a database regarding Products that a fictional store offers.

## Notable Mention

All of these endpoints are GET requests. This is because none of the provided services make any changes to the Database. 

The thought behind this was so that in the database, the application user should have view only access.
